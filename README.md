Everlasting "Hey, Yo!" per second

## Usage
```
$ docker run toricls/everlasting-hey-yo
```

then, you'll see everlasting
```
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
...
```

### Hey-yo traps SIGTERM
```
$ docker stop YOUR-CONTAINER-ID
```

then, you'll see
```
...
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Hey, Hey, Yo!!! ðŸ‘ˆ You'll find this line!
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
...
```

## So, what is this?
Hey-yo is meant to test time-diff between SIGTERM and SIGKILL sent by `docker stop` and its subsequences.

You can use Hey-yo to find whether your container orchestration tool issues docker stop with `--stop` option (or, docker run with `--stop-timeout` option) as expected.

## Build your own Hey-Yo
```
$ docker build -t YOUR-NAME/everlasting-hey-yo .
$ docker push YOUR-NAME/everlasting-hey-yo .
```
