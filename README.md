Everlasting "Hey, Yo!" per second

## Usage
```
$ docker run toricls/everlasting-hey-yo
```

then, you'll see everlasting
```
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
...
```

### Hey-yo traps SIGTERM
By default Hey-yo won't stop with SIGTERM.

If you send a SIGTERM signal to the Hey-Yo container with:
```
$ docker stop YOUR-CONTAINER-ID
```

then, you'll see the follows and Hey-Yo will keep running.
```
...
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Hey, Hey, Yo!!! ðŸ‘ˆ You'll find this line!
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
...
```

### Options
Use environment variables to change the behavior as follows.

#### 1. Let it stop with SIGTERM
Hey-Yo will respect your SIGTERM signal.
```
$ docker run -e LET_ME_DIE=1 toricls/everlasting-hey-yo
```

#### 2. More message patterns
```
$ docker run -e GIVE_ME_PATTERNS=1 toricls/everlasting-hey-yo
```

then you'll see randomized output.
```
...
Hey, Yo!
A lot of Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
A lot of Hey, Yo!
A lot of Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
Hey, Yo!
...
```

## So, what is this?
Hey-yo is meant to know the time difference between SIGTERM sent by `docker stop` and its subsequent SIGKILL, _**roughly**_.

You can use Hey-yo to find whether your container orchestration tool issues docker stop with `--stop` option (or, docker run with `--stop-timeout` option) as expected.

## Build your own Hey-Yo
```
$ docker build -t YOUR-NAME/everlasting-hey-yo .
$ docker push YOUR-NAME/everlasting-hey-yo
```
